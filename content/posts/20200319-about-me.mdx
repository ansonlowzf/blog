Thank you for visiting my blog.

I'm Anson LowZF, a father of 2 kids and a full time career working as marketing manager in a stone mansion company.

Inspired by 100DaysOfGatsby's challenge, I make my decision to start a blog to record my learning process, what I had learned, the obstables I'm facing, even mistakes I make and coding problems I'm countering. Meanwhile, I can improve my English and writing skill.

You will see me doing a lot stupid things, write noob code, not always apply DRY, struggling on developing a component, fail to apply some code and many.

To coding's senior, mentor, guru, and friends, if you found me doing wrong things in the blog. Please spend some time to correct me, teach me if possible, or share with me how to improve further.

I hope sharing my experience about **learning to code from scratch** can motivate new learner not to give up so early and easily if you find that coding is your kinds of thing, you like solving problem and You want pursue this career. In contrast, if you don't like setting in front of desk and looking at the monitor for long hour, you don't like problem solving, you should give up earlier and find other skill you prefer the most.

<!--
I have zero knowledge about coding before learning to code.

I don't even aware of code and programming behind every website

I think that website is built by visual editor software such as content management system or drag and drop offline / online editor. What? So lame so naive.

I used Wordpress to build my company website since the year of 2013.

In the year 2016, I saw an advertisement on YouTube regarding Wix. I try it out and find that itâ€™s much more simple compare, and I prefer drag and drop approach. I can control where to put my content, how my website looks.

## Why I learn to code?

I love Wordpress and Wix, you can find a lot of article talking the benefits of using them.

They can provide 90%

I will just talk a few things I don't like

### Costly

You have to subscribe to monthly plan, higher tier provide more function. If you need advance function, you have to buy plugin.

I'm talking about wordpress.com, I do not suggest you to use wordpress.org to build your own website.

You might do something wrong and take very long time to settle, your wordpress setup might has some vulnarable security issue. Not safe for you and your visitor.

There are a lot of professional wordpress developer. You can pay to hire them to build your wordpress's website.

But, if you can pay to hire a wordpress develop to build your website, why not just use wordpress.com? The wordpress's team and company doing very great job to make sure your website is safe.

### Cumbersome

Said if you have a new link you want to change in 11 different blog post. You have to find them out and change them one by one.

You have to manually adjust margin, padding,

You are limited to some function

## Heavy

I can build a minimalist website with just the elements I need

I can control how my

I can build a fast

## I struggling to or not to give up

I don't know how many times my evil's mind ask me to give up on learning to code

I have limited time to learn. My wife is also working to contribute household expenses. Hence, she take the babysitter and household manager and I'm become the homechef and household assistant after working hour.

By the time, I can start learning, it's 8pm

Let's see how my mind attack me with nuclear bomb:-

> "You have short time to learn coding, how many years you need to learn then only can build your first website?"

> You are too old to learn coding, your brain muscle is rotten.

> Your work not give you enough pressure? Why make your life so stress?

> Your English is so lousy, you're not tired to check google dictionary so often?

> Why you want to learn coding? Why can't you Just focus on your current work?

> They are so many talented in the industry. There is no place for you anymore. Give up is so easy

> Coding is hard, programming is even harder. See? Everything you learn is hard to apply. Give up can make your life easier.

> You are not talented, you always forget what you learn and don't know how to apply what you learn. How many times, your brain is blank in front of your PC?

> You kids need a father as companion, you should give up your learning time and accompany your kids

> Your home is so noisy, you cannot concentrate. Why not give up and play with your kids?

> Look at those happy gathering photo your friend share on Facebook. Why don't go join them?

> You should have more time to rest, rest can increase your productive on the next day.

> Life is short, don't make your life so difficult.

> There are so many CRM platform to choose for your company website, why waste so long hour to learn? What you can do with coding can just do by Wordpress or Wix

> Wow, It's feel so relief to just give up, aren't you? Enjoy your short life.

Since, 2018 May 25th I created a github account

If you check out my github, those long empty "no contribution" timeline is when I'm struggling whether I should continue learn to code.

It's not easy, persistant is hard
