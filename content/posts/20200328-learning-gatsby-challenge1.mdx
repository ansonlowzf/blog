Thank you Gatsby's team and Hashim Warren to start the 100DaysOfGatsby challenge. Although, I not 100% follow the challenge, I read the challenge and pick what I need to learn and document in my blog.

## Challenge 1: Create a Gatsby Blog from Scratch

The bonus tips inspired me to start a blog,

> Use your new blog to track your #100DaysOfGatsby progress! Research shows that writing about what you learn, or even what you're struggling with helps you to retain that information, or even discover a solution. So, during your #100DaysOfGatsby journey, we encourage you to use this blog to write about your ups and downs, victories and challenges.

## Gatsby Starter

I start browsing the <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.org/starters/?v=2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gatsby Starter Library</a>. There are around 133 blog starters. After browsing for 1 hour++, I still can't decide which starter to use for my personal blog.

So, I keep digging gatsbyjs's website until I reach <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/using-a-theme/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">this part of the website</a> and see a starter which cannot be found in gatsby starter library, weird huh?

I follow the guide and run the command,

```shell
gatsby new my-blog https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog-theme
```

Then

```shell
cd my-blog
gatsby develop
```

Error? Invalid Hook?

Scroll back and check which part I make wrong,

Check 1, check 2, check 3, I did follow the exact guide, what happened?

Dig here dig there, wondering...

20 mins later, oh... maybe I need to run,

```shell
npm install
```

Since I run npm install, without thinking further I also run:-

```shell
npm update
```

I want to make sure every packages are up to date,

Then, I run

```shell
gatsby develop
```

Well, it's successfully showing on my localhost:8000,

Feel touching and tear rolling at the edge of my eyes,

Debugging is time consuming, you know it ya?

Wow, It's seen like a blog with Gatsbyjs theme which is similar to Dan Abramov's blog named [overreacted.io](https://overreacted.io/).

I like it and start imagine myself to write like Dan Abramov,

Bang my head on to the wall, ok enough day dreaming.

Continue follow the guide

## Replace your avatar

The guide said

> The blog theme starter ships with a solid gray image for the avatar. Add your own avatar by choosing the image you want, and overwriting the file located at /content/assets/avatar.png.

Let me find a handsome photo and put in the content/assets photo

Found one and rename it to ansonlowzf-handsome-photo.jpg

Drop it to content/assets folder

En... where the heck, I can modify and path to ansonlowzf-handsome-photo.jpg?

Check gatsby-config.js file, package.json? I open every file and check line by line,

Where? where is it?

10 mins later, finish checking all existing file

I not sure how to change the path,

**if you know, please teach me.** My email is zhanfaye@gmail.com

No choice, I have to rename it to avatar.jpg

Finally, my handsome face show up,

## Replace the content of the bio

This one is pretty straigh forward

I check **node_modules/gatsby-theme-blog**

![node module gatsby them blog](../assets/gatsby-theme-blog.png)

It's mean I create a file name exactly match the name as shown in the component and put it in gatsby-theme-blog/components

My file will overwrite or replace the default

This is called component shadowing, learn a new thing today!

Open **bio-content.js** which already exist in the folder and start write my own content

> I'm from Malaysia, my pleasure to be a digital marketer and learning to be a web developer

## Create a new blog post

It's straight forward, just add your file with mdx extention and save it to content/posts

## Change the color theme

There is a file **colors.js** created and exist in **gatsby-plugin-theme-ui**

I uncommented and immedietely change to lightblue theme

It's that simple to start a blog, you can do it too.

Thank you for reading...
