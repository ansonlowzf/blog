## Challenge 1: Create a Gatsby Blog from Scratch

If you are interested in the challenge, you could check out <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.org/blog/100days/start-blog/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>

I started the blog by checking out the <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.org/starters/?v=2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gatsby Starter Library</a>. There are around 133 blog starters. After checking for 1 hour++ (don't know how many starters I checked), I still canâ€™t decide which one to use for a personal blog.

Take a rest, grab a cup of coffee...

Continue browsing gatsbyjs's website. I've forgetten how and why, I star digging gatsbyjs doc then I reach <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/using-a-theme/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">this part of the website</a> and see a starter which cannot be found in gatsby starter library, weird huh?

Run the command,

```shell
gatsby new my-blog https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog-theme
```

Then

```shell
cd my-blog
gatsby develop
```

What? error...! Invalid Hook...?

Double-check the instruction,

Check 1, check 2, check 3, I did follow the exact guide. What is problem? Scratching head...

Dig here dig there, wondering... scractching head...

20 mins later, oh... maybe I need to run,

```shell
npm install
```

Since I run npm install, without thinking further I also run:-

```shell
npm update
```

This is to make sure every package are up to date,

Ok, let me run

```shell
gatsby develop
```

Well, it's run on localhost:8000,

Tear rolling at the edge of my eyes, I can do it

Debugging is time consuming, you know it ya?

Wow, It looks like a blog with pre-config with Gatsbyjs theme which is similar to Dan Abramov's blog named [overreacted.io](https://overreacted.io/).

I like it and start to imagine I write a blog like Dan Abramov, Bang!

Bang my head on to the wall, enough daydreaming.

Continue to follow the guide

## Replace your avatar

The guide said

> The blog theme starter ships with a solid gray image for the avatar. Add your own avatar by choosing the image you want, and overwriting the file located at /content/assets/avatar.png.

Let me find a handsome photo and put in the content/assets photo

Found one and rename it to ansonlowzf-handsome-photo.jpg

Drop it to content/assets folder

En... where the heck, I can modify and path to ansonlowzf-handsome-photo.jpg?

Check gatsby-config.js file, package.json? I open every file and check line by line,

Oh, mama, how can I config it?

10 mins later,

I give up,

**if you know, please teach me.** My email is zhanfaye@gmail.com

I rename it to avatar.jpg

Finally, my handsome face show up,

## Replace the content of the bio

This one is pretty straigh forward

I check **node_modules/gatsby-theme-blog**

![node module gatsby them blog](../assets/gatsby-theme-blog.png)

It's mean we could just create a file exactly match the name as shown in the component and save it in \*\*src/gatsby-theme-blog/components

Our file will overwrite it

This is called component shadowing, learn a new thing today!

Open **bio-content.js** which already exist in the folder and start write my own content and save.

Wow... so easy to change the bio-content. Gatsbyjs with theme is so cool

## Create a new blog post

Just add a file with mdx extention and save it to content/posts

It's automatically appear in blog list and create the blog post. So simple, so fast

## Change the color theme

There is a file **colors.js** exist in **gatsby-plugin-theme-ui**

Just uncommented, the theme immedietaly change to light blue

It's that simple to start a blog, you should try it out.

Thank you for reading...
