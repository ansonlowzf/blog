Hi, Thank you for visiting my blog. I'm Anson LowZF, a father of 2 kids and wprking as full-time digital marketing manager in a stone mansion company.

Inspired by 100DaysOfGatsby's challenge and <a href='https://www.taniarascia.com/' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>Tania Rascia's blog</a>. I decided to start a blog to document my learning experience and process as a web developer and digital marketer. Meanwhile, I could improve my english and writing skill too.

You will find 2 types of writing tone while you are reading this blog

1. Described my learning process
2. A person talking to you

## What you will see in this blog?

1. The technology I am learning
2. The coding obstacles I'm facing and how I go through it
3. Tips & Trick I found useful by reading an article or watching YouTube
4. Noob code I wrote and how I improve it
5. Mistakes I made and how I solve them
6. Struggling in a certain task or development and I don't know how to solve it. Winks~ at least at that moment

## Calling for help

To: Coding's senior, mentor, guru, and friends,

If you discover something wrong or error in this blog, please correct me. Feel free to reach me @ <a href="mailto:zhanfaye@gmail.com">zhanfaye@gmail.com</a>

## It's never too late

I start my web development journey with zero knowledge, without a computer science degree and from the age of 36. If I can build something out, you can do it too.

## Don't give up too early

You will see me doing a lot of wrong thing, code not working as expected and how I solve it. I share my experience in this blog and hope it can motivate you not to give up so early and easily. Every web developer has to go through this process. In contrast, if you don't like sitting long time in front of desk looking at the monitor, you don't like problem solving, and you don't like to keep learning, you should give up earlier and find other skill you prefer the most.

## Why I learn to code?

I love Wordpress and Wix, you can find a lot of article talking the benefits of using them.

They can provide 90%

I will just talk a few things I don't like

### Costly

You have to subscribe to monthly plan, higher tier provide more function. If you need advance function, you have to buy plugin.

I'm talking about wordpress.com, I do not suggest you to use wordpress.org to build your own website.

You might do something wrong and take very long time to settle, your wordpress setup might has some vulnarable security issue. Not safe for you and your visitor.

There are a lot of professional wordpress developer. You can pay to hire them to build your wordpress's website.

But, if you can pay to hire a wordpress develop to build your website, why not just use wordpress.com? The wordpress's team and company doing very great job to make sure your website is safe.

### Cumbersome

Said if you have a new link you want to change in 11 different blog post. You have to find them out and change them one by one.

You have to manually adjust margin, padding,

You are limited to some function

## Heavy

I can build a minimalist website with just the elements I need

I can control how my

I can build a fast

## I struggling to or not to give up

I don't know how many times my evil's mind ask me to give up on learning to code

I have limited time to learn. My wife is also working to contribute household expenses. Hence, she take the babysitter and household manager and I'm become the homechef and household assistant after working hour.

By the time, I can start learning, it's 8pm

Let's see how my mind attack me with nuclear bomb:-

> "You have short time to learn coding, how many years you need to learn then only can build your first website?"

> You are too old to learn coding, your brain muscle is rotten.

> Your work not give you enough pressure? Why make your life so stress?

> Your English is so lousy, you're not tired to check google dictionary so often?

> Why you want to learn coding? Why can't you Just focus on your current work?

> They are so many talented in the industry. There is no place for you anymore. Give up is so easy

> Coding is hard, programming is even harder. See? Everything you learn is hard to apply. Give up can make your life easier.

> You are not talented, you always forget what you learn and don't know how to apply what you learn. How many times, your brain is blank in front of your PC?

> You kids need a father as companion, you should give up your learning time and accompany your kids

> Your home is so noisy, you cannot concentrate. Why not give up and play with your kids?

> Look at those happy gathering photo your friend share on Facebook. Why don't go join them?

> You should have more time to rest, rest can increase your productive on the next day.

> Life is short, don't make your life so difficult.

> There are so many CRM platform to choose for your company website, why waste so long hour to learn? What you can do with coding can just do by Wordpress or Wix

> Wow, It's feel so relief to just give up, aren't you? Enjoy your short life.

Since, 2018 May 25th I created a github account

If you check out my github, those long empty "no contribution" timeline is when I'm struggling whether I should continue learn to code.

It's not easy, persistant is hard
