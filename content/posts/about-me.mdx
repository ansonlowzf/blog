Hi, Thank you for visiting my blog.

I'm Anson LowZF, a father of 2 kids and working as a full-time digital marketing manager in a stonemason company.

Inspired by [100DaysOfGatsby's challenge][gatsby-100days-challenge] and [Tania Rascia's blog][tania-blog], I decided to start a blog to document my learning experience and record my learning process about web development. Meanwhile, I also take this opportunity to improve my English and writing skill.

[gatsby-100days-challenge]: https://www.gatsbyjs.org/blog/tags/100-days-of-gatsby/

I hesitate to start a blog because it takes time and passion to maintain a blog. I don't know what good about blogging until I found this bonus tip in 100DaysOfGatsby's challenge 1. It's a final blow to kick my ass to start a blog.

> "Use your new blog to track your #100DaysOfGatsby progress! Research shows that writing about what you learn, or even what you're struggling with helps you to **retain that information**, or even **discover a solution**. So, during your #100DaysOfGatsby's journey, we encourage you to use this blog to write about your ups and downs, victories and challenges."

It's so true, Hashim. I always forget what I've just learned. Sometimes, I can't even find the place I learned this and that when I want to apply this and that in my project.

I know writing blog while learning significantly slow down my learning pace. Most importantly I can retain information or discover a solution. Plus, I can refer back whenever I forget something. I should start blogging earlier, the benefits of blogging are essential to a working father who constantly distracted by work, children and noise.

I always break code and making errors. Sometimes, I did it to test how the code work. Most of the time, I don't know how I break the code. What even worst is sometimes I don't know how to fix the code back and need to delete the whole project and start from scratch again.

## It's never too late

I'm self-taught, start my web development journey with zero knowledge, without a computer science degree and from the age of 36. If I can build something, you can do it too.
