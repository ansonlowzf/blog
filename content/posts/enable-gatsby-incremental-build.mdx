Received an email from Netlify last week, said Gatsby.js released something called incremental builds to reduces the amount of work required to build a Gatsby.js site.

## What is the incremental builds?

Based on my understanding, it's something like when I push my website update to Netlify.
Instead of rebuilding the entire site, Netlify will just update the part I make a change.
Significantly decrease the Netlify build time especially for a large site.

The more you consume Netlify build time, the more you need to pay.
First 300 minutes of build time is FREE,
Next 500 minutes is US 7.

Enable user to reduce the build time with plugin will lower Netlify company's profit?
Or bring more benefits to Netlify?
I don't know, enable this kind of plugin is buddha's heart.

Although, my site still not large. >.<
But, this will not stop me from trying out.

Let's dig the guide!

## Step 1: Upgrade Gatsby.js to the latest

Must be latest than v2.20.4. By the time you read this, Gatsby.js surely latest than the required version. In case you want to check out the version of Gatsby.js:-

```sh
npm list gatsby
```

The time I run this command, my Gatsby.js version is v2.20.36

## Step 2: Enable Netlify Build Plugins

I log in to my Netlify account, navigate to the right-hand upper corner. Click **Build Plugins**

Then click **Enable the beta**

Ops, I cannot find my blog to enable the Netlify build plugin.
Maybe my site still small in bundle?
