This article is to share how I use “Git Version Control (Git)” and “GitHub” in my web development project.

## Why Use Git Version Control?

You might ask, why I need to use Git since I’m a lone-wolf? These are the reasons:-

- To keep track of the code I wrote and revise it if needed.
- I can do multiple works simultaneously.
- I can rewind to any version I want.

## Why Must Use GitHub?

- My code is safe even I lost my computer
- In case I broke my code, I have a backup.
- Something wrong with the codebase in your local development

> **Tips**
>
> Don't run `npm update` on your master branch. If any of the dependancies has error, you going to face a chaos. Often, you've to wait until the maintainer fix the error.

In case you just want a reference, I document the often use Git CLI in this [Cheatsheet](/git-cli-you-should-know).

## How Do I Work With Git As A Self-taught Developer?

Prerequisite

- This is not a tutorial article, I assume you already have some basic knowledge about Git & GitHub.
- If you don’t know what is Git & GitHub, I encourage you to take this [Git tutorial](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/what-is-version-control) before reading further.
- This is an experience talk about Git & GitHub.

### Started A New Project

When I start a new project. I’ll just use the master branch. Since I work alone, I don’t create branches just to build a page, section, or feature. The only exceptional case is when I want to test a feature which I not familiar at all. It’s not fun to switch from branch to branch for a startup website.

### After Deploying The Project

After deploying the website in production. I’ll not directly modify a single code in the master branch. I have to make sure, no broken codes are going to pollute the master branch.

### Create Branches To Update The Project

This is when **git branch** come in handy. Take this blog as an example.

I create the following branches:-

- gitworkflow-blog
- webresources-blog
- pagination-feature
- hero-style
- And so on

You may have noticed, I write the word “blog”, “feature” or “style” at the end of a branch name.

Why?

The main reason is I use autocompletion in the terminal.

After I created the branches, I can just type “git” (the first 3 letters) then press tab in the keyboard to autocomplete the branch name.

If I write the word “blog” in the beginning, I have to always type the “blog” word which is a repetition.

### Merge the branch

After finish writing a blog post, add and commit the blog post. Switch to master branch and run `git merge branchName` in the terminal. Then push to the remote master branch.

However, I prefer to merge the branch in GitHub.

## Merge Pull Request (PR) in GitHub

I often merge the pull request in GitHub. You might say, this is a bit redundant. But I have a few reasons why I do so.

- I merge the PR only when I want to update my blog. It's like scheduling update my blog
- It's flexible to merge the PR remotely with GitHub mobile app.
- I know how to contribute to an open-source project. It works similarly.

### How To Merge Pull Request In GitHub?

Say you just finish writing a blog post and push to your GitHub repository

```
git push origin blog-post
```

When you visit your GitHub repository, you will see **Compare & pull request** shows up.

Click to create a pull request

![click to create a pull request](https://res.cloudinary.com/ansonlowzf/image/upload/v1590561836/AnsonLowZF%20Blog/open-pull-request_br9um7.png)

The title is your commit message. Write your new title if needed, and write your description to help you understand the pull request in future.

Most importantly, help your partner or colleague to understand the PR.

If you are contributing to open source project. You should write it in short and concise to help the maintainer to easily pick up the PR.

Don’t follow what I do in this part. I not writing the description. Ya, I know, it’s not a good practice. I’ll only write the description if PR is not obvious which I need to write a note to help me to recall. I work alone anyway, bleh~ Good excuses~

Sorry guys, forgive my laziness and you should follow good practice. Please write a description.

Ok, next…

Once you finish writing your title and description, create your pull request and confirm the merge all by yourself. It seems a bit weird at first, it’s like you are playing 2 roles in this situation. It’s good to learn how to act as the project’s maintainer and the contributor at once, isn’t it?

Finally, merge the pull request to your master branch.

Delete the branch you no longer using, and keep the branch if you want to reuse it.
