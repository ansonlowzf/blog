title: Git Workflow As A Self-Taught Developer

Today blog is to share how I use git version control and GitHub in my web development project.

I also document the git CLI I often use in [Git Command Cheatsheet](/git-cli-you-should-know)

## Work With Master Branch At First

When I start a new project.
I only use the master branch until I launch the project.
It's not practical to work in different branches before the project on live.

## Create Branches And Constantly Update The Project

Take this blog as an example

I created the branches as following

1. **add-blog-post1** - To add new blog post, error optimization & update blog
1. **add-blog-post2** -
1. **feature** - To add a feature such as tags, pagination (still working)
1. **Style** - To test the CSS style

If needed, I will create more branches to complete a certain task.

The best benefit working with branches is my master branch will never be polluted especially I use Netlify continuous deployment.
Whenever I push my code to my GitHub master branch, Netlify will run a build to update my project.

Just imagine if I use master branch and my codes are broken, what can I do?
Except running `git checkout -- .` to reset to the last commit, I not sure what else I can do.

## Pull Request (PR) in GitHub

Yes, I merge the pull request in GitHub rather than merging it locally.
Although, Iâ€™m self-employed. I keep this practice.
Someday in future, When I need a partner or I hire a person to work in my project.
I already know how to do pull request in GitHub.

Do you know GitHub has iOS and Android app now?
I can merge the pull request remotely whenever my partner or developer push the new update.

## How To Perform Pull Request In GitHub?

Say you just finish writing a blog post and push to your GitHub repository

```sh
git push origin blog-post
```

When you visit your GitHub repository, you will see **Compare & pull request** shows up.

Click to open a pull request

![open pull request](https://res.cloudinary.com/ansonlowzf/image/upload/v1590561836/AnsonLowZF%20Blog/open-pull-request_br9um7.png)

The title is your commit message.
Write your new title if needed, and write your description to help you understand the pull request in future.

Most importantly, help your partner or colleague to understand what is this PR about.

If you are contributing to open source project.
You should write it in short and concise to help the maintainer to easily pick up what your PR is about.

Don't follow what I do in this part.
I not writing a description.
Ya, I know, it's not a good practice.
I'll only write the description if I push complicated update which I need to write a note to remind me something.
I work alone anyway, bleh~

Sorry guys, forgive me laziness and please write a description.

Ok, continue...

![comfirm merge](https://res.cloudinary.com/ansonlowzf/image/upload/v1590561984/AnsonLowZF%20Blog/confirm-merge_umrvhl.png)

Once you finish writing your title and description, create your pull request and confirm the merge by yourself.
It seem a bit weird at first, it's like you are playing 2 roles at once - the maintainer and the contributor.
It's good to learn 2 roles in your project, isn't it?

![merge pull request](https://res.cloudinary.com/ansonlowzf/image/upload/v1590562150/AnsonLowZF%20Blog/merge-pull-request_wy19lb.png)

Finally, merge the pull request to your master branch.
If you are using Netlify or similar hosting service, your website will be updated.

![merge completed](https://res.cloudinary.com/ansonlowzf/image/upload/v1590562287/AnsonLowZF%20Blog/merge-completed_wekbpc.png)

You might want to delete the branch if you are a maintainer of an open-source project.
In my case, I don't delete any branch in my project.
Every branch I created have a role.
