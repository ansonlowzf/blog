I understand frontmatter in Markdown first before I can understand how to sort blogpost by date, id, or any property you want. Normally, we sort by the latest date on top in descending order.

Today I learned (TIL) how to sort blogposts with vanilla JavaScript.

## Array.sort()

When I first see the code:-

```js
frontmatterData.sort((a, b) => {
  if (a.date < b.date) {
    return -1
  } else {
    return 1
  }
})
```

My head is fainting, what this a.date or b.date does?

Why not just write earlyDate < laterDate? laterDate is greater than earlyDate, so laterDate go top first.

Why must return -1 first then return 1?

I head to MDN JavaScript <a href='https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/sort' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>**sort()**</a> docs read it again and again. I started to pick up during the fourth time of reading.

## Sort Array of Objects

First, let's look at frontmatter. I know the output of frontmatter is an array of objects like so:-

```js
const frontmatterData = [
  { title: "a", date: `2020-03-01`, text: "a..." },
  { title: "b", date: `2020-03-02`, text: "b..." },
  { title: "c", date: `2020-03-03`, text: "c..." },
  { title: "d", date: `2020-03-04`, text: "d..." },
  { title: "e", date: `2020-03-05`, text: "e..." },
]
```

Now, I understand what **a.date** does now.

It's mean if we want to sort by date, we must access date in the parameter "a" and compare the date in parameter "b".

let's look at the code again, "a" and "b" are the parameter we provide to the function.

```js
frontmatterData.sort((a, b) => {
  if (a.date < b.date) {
    return -1
  } else {
    return 1
  }
})
```

We can also sort in by title (a.title, b.title), by description (a.description, b.description).

Based on my understanding,

When comparing **a.date** with **b.date** return 0, sort remain unchange

If a > b, return 1 which is greater than 0, index a > index b, said index a is 1, index b = 0, then **"b"** come first = sort in descending order

If a < b, return -1 which is lesser than 0, index a < index b, said index a is 1, index b = 2, then **"a"** come first = sort in ascending order.

**Note**: If I understand it wrong way, please reach me out @ <a href='https://twitter.com/ansonlowzf' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>Twitter</a> to share your thought with me. Your kindness is much appreciated.

We can just change the greater (>) and the lesser (<) sign with same return value will change ascending or descending order

Or swap the -1 and 1 value will also work

If you want test it out yourself:-
