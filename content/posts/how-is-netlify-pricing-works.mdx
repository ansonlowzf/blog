I don't believe there is free lunch in the world until I step into the tech community.
Most of the software, apps, libraries, frameworks are free to use.
It's hard to believe at first, I were thinking some fees might

Tech community is one of the best community in the world, developers are contributing their knowledge to make the world improving

Netlify is one of the enterprise tech services that provide set 'A' free lunch,
It's changed my mind, there is a real free lunch,
The starter free tier is real FREE until you grow big.

I build my company's website with Wordpress.com,
I need to pay a fee to remove Wordpress watermark,
Although it's not a big fee, what I pretty sure is, I need to pay first

When I start learning web development, it's already a modern development era.
JAMstack, serverless architecture, deploy with CDN, a website on the cloud and more.

After I learned HTML, CSS, and some front-end JavaSript,
I built an ugly website and would like to test how deployment Works.

I researched and googled around, I found something like FTP, FileZilla, CyberDuck, web hosting server, shared hosting, dedicated server and something related.

Still... I need to pay first to lease a server for one year then only I can test the deployment (maybe some services give a free trial, I not sure).
So, I continue my learning until I can make a beautiful or at least functional website then only lease a server to test deployment.

I start learning Vue.js 2 - I confused and not sure how to wire the component to make a website.
Then I try learning React.js. I not sure why I pick up React.js more easily.

After learning the basic, I pick Gatsby.js as my React framework. This is the time completely change my web deployment experience.

I exposed to Netlify, Firebase, Verccel (Zeit Now), Surge and GitHub Pages.

Influenced by Gatsby.js, [Jason Lengstorf][jason twitter], [Sarah Drasner][sarah twitter], I choose to host my company's website with Netlify.

I rebuilt my company's website from Wix to Gatsby.js and Material-UI and learn to deploy the website to Netlify.
(Ops! I forget to mention, I changed my company's website from Wordpress.com to Wix in the years of 2017. Wix is amazing at first, but not so fun when you scale up your website. Maybe, I might write a post about my experience with Wix in the future.)

Before that and to play safe.
I checked the Netlify pricing plan first.
I don't want either I pay $0 fee or $45 for the pro tier.
It's expensive in my country currency - Malaysia
USD 45 = RM 180 ++ per month.
I was worrying especially I just started to learn web development with zero profit.
Yes, I once confused by Netlify pricing plan because I held a subjective mind about pricing tier should be the same with traditional web hosting scheme.

Dig here, dig there, dig...
The price plan is very obvious but because of the subjective mind,
My eyes are blind and I not sure

> How much Netlify will charge me after the free tier?

I start googling around and read some articles about Netlify in StackOverflow and quora.

I confirmed,

> Netlify starter is real FREE!

A free lunch? A super-fast hosting service is FREE?

> I think is impossible but it's happening right now.

After a few months of using Netlify and continue reading more article about Netlify

I started to understand the pricing plan, and I not so blind now after opening my mind to modern web development.

> I found out the starter free tier plan is smartly calculated

It supports start-up for free and scalable

## How is Netlify Pricing Plan Works?

Say you're a freelancer, you build and host your client website with Netlify.
Every time, you push to update any websites to Netlify.
Build time is calculated.

Starter tier comes with 300 minutes of build time per month.
It's mean if you frequently update websites, you're going to reach the build time quota fast.
Exceeded the build time, you need to pay USD 7 to purchase the next 500 minutes of build time.

300 min. is more than enough for a new developer to host a personal blog.
When you start your web development business, one day you will hit the quota.
You can use it smartly, and save some of the build time.
I mentioned it when I talk about <Link to=''>Cloudinary</Link>.
You wouldn't want to save the cost and tell your client to update their website next month, wouldn't you?

## What other aspects might cost you money?

Say your blog starts getting traffic this month and you're not sure how but you are a superstar in web development now.
So many new, senior, guru, and mentor developers visit your website and you hit your starter free tier - 100GB bandwidth this month.
So what now?
Netlify will charge you USD 20 for the next 100GB bandwidth.
Is it worth to pay USD 20 to be a superstar developer?

What if you not hitting this 100GB bandwidth next month?
You save USD 20.

## The final aspect will cost you money

Your superstar blog getting more popular a few months later.
You need a team member to work with you,
Adding 1 team member will cost you USD 15 per month.

What if you grow big and need a third team member?
I suggest you upgrade to pro tier at this time.

USD 45 come with:-

1. 1000 build times
1. 400GB bandwidth
1. 3 team members
1. 3 concurrent builds
1. more
