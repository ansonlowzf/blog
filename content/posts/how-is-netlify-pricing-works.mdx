I don't believe there is free lunch in the world until I step into the tech community.
Tech community is one of the best community in the world, developers around the world are contributing to make the world a better place to live with technology.

Most of the software, apps, libraries, frameworks are free to use as long as we keep it open source.
I'm so glad to join the tech community.

Netlify is one of the enterprise tech service's companies that provide a set of free lunch to support the developer - the starter plan.

## Pay first for the service

I build my company's website with Wordpress.com,
I need to pay first to remove Wordpress branding watermark.

When I start learning web development, it's already a modern development era.
JAMstack, serverless architecture, deploy with CDN, a website on the cloud and more.

After I learned HTML, CSS, and some front-end JavaSript,
I built an ugly website and would like to test out how deployment works.

I researched and googled around, I found something like FTP, FileZilla, CyberDuck, web hosting server, shared hosting, dedicated server and something related.

Still... I need to pay first to lease a server then only I can test the deployment (maybe some service provider give a free trial, I not sure).

## Turning point

So, I decide to continue my learning until I can make a proper website then only lease a server to test the deployment.

I start learning Vue.js 2 - I confused and not sure how to wire the component to make a website.
Then I try learning React.js. I not sure why it' easier for me to understand React.js.

After learning the basic, I pick Gatsby.js as my React framework. This is a turning point that completely changes my web deployment experience.

I exposed to Netlify, Firebase, Verccel (Zeit Now), Surge and GitHub Pages.

Influenced by Gatsby.js, [Jason Lengstorf][jason twitter], [Sarah Drasner][sarah twitter], I choose to host my company's website with Netlify.

I rebuilt my company's website from Wix to Gatsby.js and Material-UI and learn to deploy the website to Netlify.

Ops! I forget to mention, I changed my company's website from Wordpress.com to Wix in the years of 2017. Wix is amazing at first, but not so fun when you scale up your website. Maybe, I might write a post about my experience with Wix in the future.

To play safe, I checked the Netlify pricing plan first.
I don't want Netlify to surprise me with a USD 45 pro tier bill.
It's expensive in my country currency - Malaysia.

USD 45 = RM 190++ per month.
I was worrying especially I just started to learn web development with zero profit.

Yes, I once confused by Netlify pricing plan because I held a subjective mind about all pricing plan should be the same - a pay to lease scheme.

## How Netlify Pricing Works?

[Netlify Pricing Plan ](https://www.netlify.com/pricing/)

Dig here, dig there, dig...
The price plan is very obvious but because of the subjective mind,
My eyes are blind and I not sure

> How much is Netlify going to charge me after I exceed the free tier? USD 45?

I start googling around and read some articles about Netlify in StackOverflow and Quora.

Then only I confirmed,

> Netlify starter tier is real FREE!

A free lunch? A super-fast hosting service is FREE? It's unbelievable but it's happening.

After a few months of using Netlify and continue reading more article about Netlify

I started to understand the pricing plan, and I not so blind now after opening my mind to modern web development architecture.

> I found out the starter free tier plan is smartly calculated.

It supports start-up for free and scalable

## How is Netlify Pricing Plan Works?

Say you're a freelancer, you build and host your client website with Netlify.
Every time, you push to update any websites to Netlify.
Build time is calculated.

Starter tier comes with 300 minutes of build time per month.
It's mean if you frequently update websites, you're going to reach the build time quota fast.
Exceeded the build time, you need to pay USD 7 to purchase the next 500 minutes of build time.

300 min. is more than enough for a new developer to host a personal blog.
When you start your web development business, one day you will hit the quota.
You can use it smartly, and save some of the build time.
I mentioned it when I talk about [Cloudinary](/move-my-image-folder-to-cloudinary/).
You wouldn't want to save the cost and tell your client to update their website next month, wouldn't you?

## What other aspects might cost you money?

Say your blog starts getting traffic this month and you're not sure how but you are a superstar in web development now.
So many new, senior, guru, and mentor developers visit your website and you hit your starter free tier - 100GB bandwidth this month.

So what now?
Netlify will charge you USD 20 for the next 100GB bandwidth.
Is it worth to pay USD 20 to be a superstar developer?

What if you not hitting this 100GB bandwidth next month?
You save USD 20.

## The final aspect will cost you money

Your superstar blog getting more popular a few months later.
You need a team member to work with you,
Adding 1 team member will cost you USD 15 per month.

What if you grow big and need a third team member?
I suggest you upgrade to the pro plan at this time.

USD 45 come with:-

1. 1000 build times
1. 400GB bandwidth
1. 3 team members
1. 3 concurrent builds
1. more

Reaching this stage means you can afford to pay the pro tier. What if you have an open-source project?
Contact [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/support/). I heard Netlify help to host a open-source project.
(Correct me if I'm wrong)
