## Gatsby Starter

[Gatsby Starter Library](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/starters/?v=2)

After browsing the starter library for 1 hour+, I don't find any blog starter I like

So, I keep browsing gatsbyjs's website until I reach [this part of the website](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/using-a-theme/) and see a starter which cannot be found in gatsby starter library, weird huh?

I follow the guide and run the command

```shell
gatsby new my-blog https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog-theme
```

Wow, seen like a blog with Gatsby theme which is inspired by Dan Abramov's blog named [overreacted.io](https://overreacted.io/)

I like it and start imagine myself to write like Dan Abramov,

Bang my head on to the wall, ok enough day dreaming.

Continue follow the guide

```shell
cd my-blog
gatsby develop
```

What the heck... Error?

Scroll back and see whether I did follow the guide,

Check 1, check 2, check 3, exactly the same, why error happen? invalid hook?

Dig here dig there, wondering...

Maybe I need to run, let me try

```shell
npm install
```

Since I run npm install, without thinking further I also run:-

```shell
npm update
```

Please, error go away

```shell
gatsby develop
```

Well, it's successfully showing on my localhost:8000

Feel touching, tear rolling at the edge of my eyes

It's works, next...

## Replace your avatar

The guide said

The blog theme starter ships with a solid gray image for the avatar. Add your own avatar by choosing the image you want, and overwriting the file located at /content/assets/avatar.png.

Let me find a handsome photo and put in the content/assets photo

Found one and rename it to ansonlowzf-handsome-photo.jpg

Ok, drop it to content/assets folder

En... where the heck, I can modify and path to ansonlowzf-handsome-photo

Check gatsby-config.js file, package.json? I open every file and see

I have no idea, **if you know, please teach me**

My email is zhanfaye@gmail.com

No choice, I have to rename it to avatar.jpg

What? Still no show up? The photo disappear

Why? scroll back and check the guide

Ops, I have to rename it to avatar.png T_T

Oh! Finally, my handsome face show up, next...

## Replace the content of the bio

This one is pretty straigh forward

I check **node_modules/gatsby-theme-blog**

![node module gatsby them blog](../assets/gatsby-theme-blog.png)

It's mean I create file name exactly match the name as shown in the component and put it in gatsby-plugin-theme-ui

My file content will overwrite or replace the default one

This is called component shadowing, learn a new thing today!

Open **bio-content.js** which already exist in the folder and start write my own content

The rest is pretty staight forward...

Afterward, I started to own a blog which you are reading now...

Thank you for stoping by
