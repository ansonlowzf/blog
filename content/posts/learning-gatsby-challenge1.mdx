Writing blog while learning slow down my learning pace, but gain the benefit of retaining information. I should have started it earlier.

## Challenge 1: Create a Gatsby blog from scratch

First, I learned the basic of gatsby.js in this <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/" target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>Gatsby's tutorials</a>. I strongly encourage you to complete the official tutorial at least once, It help you understand how gatsby.js works.

After complete the lessons, I check out the <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.org/starters/?v=2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gatsby Starter Library</a> to find a starter for my blog. After applying the filter, there are around 133 blog starters. Time passed 1 hour++, I still canâ€™t decide which one to use.

When I'm stuck, It means it's a time to take a rest and grab a cup of coffee...

Come back to the desk, continue browsing gatsby.js' website. Tic toc, tic toc, don't know how long the time had passed, I reached <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/using-a-theme/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">this page</a> and see a starter which cannot be found in the starter library, weird huh?

Open **Git Bash**, Run the command:-

```shell
gatsby new my-blog https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog-theme
```

Then:-

```shell
cd my-blog
gatsby develop
```

What? error!? The following message show in terminal

![gatsby starter blog theme error in terminal](../assets/gatsby-starter-blog-theme-error.jpg)

Double-check the page,

Check 1, check 2, check 3, every word and spelling are correct. What is the problem? Scratching head...

Dig here dig there, wondering... continue scratching head...

20 mins later, oh... maybe I need to run:-

```shell
npm install
```

But, It just audit the node packages,

Again, I try to run:-

```shell
gatsby develop
```

Open localhost:8000 in my browser.

The following error show up in the browser

![gatsby starter blog theme error in browswer](../assets/gatsby-starter-blog-theme-error2.jpg)

Close **Git Bash** and open the project folder with VS Code and run:-

```shell
gatsby develop
```

Yo! It works. Hundred of (?) appear on my head.

I not sure why it's not working in **Git Bash** but work in VS Code's terminal which also git **Git Bash**

Afterwards I update node packages `npm update` and `gatsby develop` to check out the site

This starter is pre-config with **gatsby-theme-blog** and it's look similar to Dan Abramov's blog named [overreacted.io](https://overreacted.io/). I believe this theme is inspired by it.

I like this minimalist's design and start to imagine I write like Dan Abramov

Bleh! Bang my head on to the wall, time to wake up and stop daydreaming.

Continue the guide...

## Replace your avatar

The guide said

> The blog theme starter ships with a solid gray image for the avatar. Add your own avatar by choosing the image you want, and overwriting the file located at /content/assets/avatar.png.

Let me find a handsome photo and put in the content/assets photo

Found one and rename it to ansonlowzf-handsome-photo.jpg

Drop it to content/assets folder

Hmmm... where the heck, I can modify and the path to ansonlowzf-handsome-photo.jpg?

Check gatsby-config.js file, package.json? I open every file and check line by line,

Oh, mama, how can I config it?

10 mins later,

I give up,

**if you know how to do it, please share with me.** My email is zhanfaye@gmail.com

No choice, I rename it to avatar.jpg

Finally, my handsome face show up,

### Note

If your handsome face not showing up, `Ctrl + c` to stop your development server and `gatsby-develop` to restart it. If the problem persist, stop development server, close your editor, reopen your editor and start development server again.

## Replace the content of the bio

This one is pretty straight forward

I check **node_modules/gatsby-theme-blog**

![node module gatsby them blog](../assets/gatsby-theme-blog.png)

There are 11 components in the components folder, if you create a file exactly match the name and save it into **src/gatsby-theme-blog/components**. You can overwrite or modify the component with your code.

This is called component shadowing,

Thanks gatsby.js, I learn a new thing today.

To modify **bio-content** component, navigate to **src/gatsby-theme-blog/components**, open **bio-content.js** which already exist in the folder

Overwrite with your jsx code:-

```js
import React, { Fragment } from "react"
import { Link } from "gatsby"

export default () => (
  <Fragment>
    Learning to be a digital marketer &amp; web developer.
    <br />
    <Link to="/about-me">More about me</Link>
  </Fragment>
)
```

`Ctrl + s`, the bio content next to my handsome face get updated,

Cool, isn't it?

## Create a new blog post

`Ctrl + c` to stop your development server, then

Add a file with mdx extention **my-new-blog.mdx** and save it into **content/posts**

Add the following content to **my-new-blog.mdx**

```mdx
---
title: My New Blog Post
date: 2020-01-31
---

My blog post content...
```

`gatsby develop` to start development server again

As simple as that, I created a blog post. Click the title to see my amazing blog content.

## Change the color theme

There is a file **colors.js** exist in **src/gatsby-theme-blog/gatsby-plugin-theme-ui**

Just uncommented all code in the file, your theme immedietaly change to blue color theme.

If you don't like the color theme, just modify each part of them with your color

```js
import merge from "deepmerge"
import defaultThemeColors from "gatsby-theme-blog/src/gatsby-plugin-theme-ui/colors"

const darkBlue = `#007acc`
const lightBlue = `#66E0FF`
const blueGray = `#282c35`

export default merge(defaultThemeColors, {
  text: blueGray,
  primary: darkBlue,
  heading: blueGray,
  modes: {
    dark: {
      background: blueGray,
      primary: lightBlue,
      highlight: lightBlue,
    },
  },
})
```

It's that simple to start up a blog with gatsby.js and gatsby theme, try it yourself.

Thank you for reading...
