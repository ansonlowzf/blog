title: Learning To Be A Mouse-less Web Developer In VS Code
date: 2020-05-29
tags: ["Resources"]
---

After using PC for so many years with a mouse or trackpad, we so used to point and click everything we want on the screen so fast and concise. Drag and drop, left-click, right-click, scroll the web page up and down with mouse wheel.

There are some arguments in the web development community mention that writing code without a mouse could be faster.

I'm curious to try it out. My target is to focus 90% on using the keyboard. I don't think we can 100% avoid using a mouse in a graphic user interface (GUI) environment, especially when we want to check the navigation link, button and form.

I will try my best to use the keyboard shortcut, terminal and command line in VS Code. Then document my learning to be a mouse free developer (Ops, it's should be a mouse-less developer).

I not sure I can get used to it or not. What I pretty sure is my coding speed will decrease dramatically.

**If you could also share how you code without using a mouse would be much appreciated. Let's learn together.**

Below are the keyboard shortcut and navigation I learned so far, I'll continuously update this article when I learn something new.

## First Few Days

I use mouse unconsciously, and I always have to remind myself not to use it.

## Change Cursor Colour

I change my cursor colour to yellow. So, I can see it easily.

## Open a file

### Method 1: Use Go To File

I often toggle the sidebar off with **_Ctrl + B_**. I navigate from file to file with **_Ctrl + E_** (you can also use **_Ctrl + P_**) then search the keyword of the filename and press **_Enter_** to open a file.

Example:-
Your filename is **how-to-build-a-website-with-gatsbyjs.md**, you can type **gatsbyjs** or **build a website**, VS Code will filter and show you every file match your search.

### Method 2: Use Breadcrumbs

**_Ctrl + Shift + . (full stop)_** to focus your current breadcrumbs folder.
Use **_Ctrl + right/left arrow_** to navigate between folder.
Use **_up/down arrow_** to navigate between the file.
Press **_Enter_** to open the file.

## Navigate between editor and explorer

I seldom navigate folder and file this way. I share this method with people who might find it useful.

### Method 1

**_Ctrl + Shift + E_** to focus on the explorer and **_Ctrl + Shift + E_** again to focus back to the editor.

- Use the **_up/down arrow_** to navigate between the file or folder.
- Use the **_left arrow_** to go up one directory, and right arrow to go inside a directory.
- Press **_Enter_** to open a file.

### Method 2

**_Ctrl + 0 (Zero)_** (not working in number pad) to focus on explorer, **_Ctrl + 1_** (not working in number pad) to focus back to the editor

- Use the **_up/down arrow_** to navigate between the file or folder.
- Use the **_left arrow_** to go up one directory, and right arrow to go inside a directory.
- Press Enter to open a file.

## Navigate between the editor's tab

### Method 1

- I use **_Ctrl + PgUp_** to focus on the previous tab and **_Ctrl + PgDn_** to focus on the next tab.

### Method 2

- You can use **_Ctrl + Tab_** to focus on the next tab or **_Ctrl + Shift + Tab_** to focus on the previous tab.

## Close a tab

- **_Ctrl + W_** to close the current tab

## Delete entire line

### Method 1

- Press **_Backspace_** deletes one character to the left

### Method 2

- Press **_Delete_** on the keyboard delete one character to the right

## Delete a word

- **_Ctrl + D_** to select a word (whether you are in front, back or within the word), press **_Delete_** in the keyboard to remove the word.
- Place your cursor at the end of the word you want to delete, then **_Ctrl + Backspace_** to delete the word.
- Place your cursor in front of the word, and then **_Ctrl + Delete_** to delete the word.

## Insert a new line

- **_Ctrl + Enter_** to move my cursor to a new line (go down 1 line).
- **_Ctrl + Shift + Enter_** to push existing line down and add a new line.

## Moving cursor in the editor

(Sorry for including this basic)

- The **_right arrow_** moves one character to the right
- The **_left arrow_** moves one character to the left
- The **_up arrow_** moves the cursor up one line
- The **_down arrow_** moves the cursor down one line

## Moving cursor by word

- **_Ctrl + right arrow_** moves the cursor to the end of a word
- **_Ctrl + left arrow_** move the cursor to the beginning of a word

## Moving cursor by section

- **_Home_** in the keyboard move cursor to the beginning of a line
- **_End_** in the keyboard move cursor to the end of a line
- **_Ctrl + Home_** move the cursor to the beginning of the page
- **_Ctrl + End_** move the cursor to the end of the page
- **_PgUp_** moves the cursor to the top of the editor.
- **_PgDn_** moves the cursor to the bottom of the editor.

> I use it to scroll editor sometime.

## Select a word

### Method 1

- **_Ctrl + D_** to select a word

### Method 2

- **_Ctrl + Shift + Right Arrow_** to select a word toward the right
- **_Ctrl + Shift + Left Arrow_** to select a word toward the left

## Move and select a word

- **_Ctrl + Shift + right arrow_** move the cursor and select the word toward the right.
- **_Ctrl + Shift + left arrow_** move the cursor and select the word toward left.

## Scroll the editor

- **_Ctrl + up arrow_** to scroll one line up.
- **_Ctrl + down arrow_** to scroll one line down.

> I use it to adjust the editor view.

## Open the Terminal inside VS Code

- **_Ctrl + `(backtick)_** toggle terminal panel on & off

## Open Terminal side by side

**_Ctrl + shift + 5_** to open second terminal

## Open an external Terminal

If you always forget to stop the development server before closing the VS Code.

Use **_Ctrl + Shift + C_** to open an external terminal

> if you want to change external terminal, Open VS Code setting and search **External: Windows Exec**

## Show All Command

### Method 1

- **_Ctrl + Shift + P_** to see all commands

### Method 2

I prefer pressing **_F1_** to see all commands

```html
<div>
  <article>
    <a>I'm a button</a>
  </article>
</div>
```

1. Place the cursor inside
   the tag until the beginning and the ending tag is glowing.
2. Press **_F1_**
3. Type **remove tag** 4. Press **_Enter_**
