title: Learning To Be A Mouse Free Developer In VS Code

After using PC for so many years with a mouse. We can point and click everything we want on the screen so fast and concise. Drag and drop, left-click, right-click, scroll the web page up and down with mouse wheel and so on.

There are some arguments in the web development community mention writing code without a mouse is faster and more efficient.

I'm curious to try it out. My target is to focus 90% on using a keyboard and 10% on using a mouse. I don't think we can avoid using a mouse in a graphic user interface (GUI) environment.

I will try my best just to use a keyboard, keyboard shortcut, terminal command line in VS Code. Then document my learning to be a mouse free developer (should be a mouse-less developer more accurately).

For so many years, I depend on the mouse. I not sure I can get used to it or not. What I pretty sure is my coding speed will decrease dramatically. And there are so many new things to learn. Wish me good luck.

I will share my experience about this later.

## First few days

This is the hard part, I always use my trackpad unconsciously and always need to remind myself not to use it.

## How to open a file?

1. **Ctrl + p** or **Ctrl + e** then search any word you can remember about the filename.

   Said your filename is **how-to-build-a-website-with-gatsbyjs.md**, you can just type **gatsbyjs** or **build a website**, VS Code will filter and show you every file match your searches.

2. **Ctrl + Shift + .** focus to your current breadcrumbs use **Ctrl + right/left arrow** to navigate between folder, and **up/down arrow** navigate between the file.

## How to navigate between editor and explorer?

1. **Ctrl + Shift + e** to focus on sidebar's explorer and **Ctrl + Shift + e** again to focus back to editor

2. **Ctrl + 0** (Zero) (not working in number pad) to focus on sidebar's explorer, **Ctrl + 1** (not working in number pad) to focus back to editor

## Delete the entire line

1. Don't press and hold **backspace** in the keyboard to delete a line. Said you want to delete line 28, navigate to line 28 in the editor **Ctrl + Shift + k** to delete the entire line.

2. or **Shift + delete** to delete entire line.

## Delete a word

1. **Ctrl + d** to select a word (no matter where your cursor in a word, front or back), then press **delete** in the keyboard

2. Place your cursor at the end of the word you want to delete, then **Ctrl + backspace** to delete a word

3. Place your cursor in front of the word you want to delete, then **Ctrl + delete** to delete a word

## Insert a line

1. **Ctrl + enter** add a line below, you will go down one line even your cursor is in the middle of the word
1. **Ctrl + + Shift + enter** add a line above, you will go down one line even your cursor is in the middle of the word

## Moving cursor in the editor

1. **Right Arrow** move one character to the right from your current location
1. **Left Arrow** move one character to the left from your current location
1. **Up Arrow** move the cursor up one line, hold the press for faster move
1. **Down Arrow** move the cursor down one line, hold the press for faster move
1. **Ctrl + Right Arrow** move the cursor to the beginner of a word
1. **Ctrl + Left Arrow** move the cusor to the end of a word
1. **home** in the keyboard move cursor to the beginning of a line
1. **end** in the keyboard move cursor to the end of a line
1. **Ctrl + home** move the cursor to the beginning of the page
1. **Ctrl + end** move the cursor to the end of the page
1. **backspace** delete one character to the left
1. **delete** delete one character to the right

Move the cursor to the top of the editor **_page up_** in the keyboard and move the cursor to the bottom of the editor **_page down_** in the keyboard. I use it to scroll editor sometime.

## Move the cursor and select the word along the way

**Ctrl + Shift + Right Arrow** move cursor and select the word toward right

**Ctrl + Shift + Left Arrow** move cursor and select the word toward left

## Selection

1. **Ctrl + d** to select a word
1. **Ctrl + Shift + Right Arrow** to select a word toward the right
1. **Ctrl + Shift + Left Arrow** to select a word toward the left

## Scroll the editor

To scroll one line up **_Ctrl + Up Arrow_** and to scroll one line down **_Ctrl + Down Arrow_**, I use it to adjust my editor view.

## Terminal

I always close the VS Code terminal panel while I'm coding. When I want to add a file to the git staging area, I'll **_Ctrl + `(backtick)_** toggle terminal panel and **_git add [filename]_** then **_git commit -m 'description'_**.

I find that If you just stage one file, using VS Code built-in source control is faster. **_Ctrl + Shift + g_**, navigate to the file you want to stage, click the **&plus;** sign, write your description and **_Ctrl + enter_** to commit your change.

Imagine you want to stage the following two files at the same time:-

1. /posts/how-to-be-a-good-developer.md
2. /posts/how-to-be-a-web-designer.md

Long typing right? Even you want to use the tab auto-completion. You also need to type until the **_good_** or the **_web_** word then only you can tab to auto-complete the whole filename, isn't it? This is how I stage the file while I'm practising as a mouse-less developer.

### Local development server

I have the habit to always stop the development server before I close VS Code or turn off the computer. To avoid the possibility to forget to stop it later. I prefer to use an external terminal. **_Ctrl + Shift + c_** in VS Code to open external. You will notice the external terminal you just open is in your project directory. Having a terminal open in my windows taskbar reduce the possibility I forget to stop the server.

**Note**
Default to **_windows cmd_**. if you want to change to your favourite terminal, Open VS Code setting and search **_External: windows Exec_**
