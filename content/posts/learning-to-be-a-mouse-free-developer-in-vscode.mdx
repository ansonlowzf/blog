After using PC for so many years, we're so used to the Graphical User Interface (GUI) navigation with mouse. Drag and drop, left click and right click, scroll up and down with mouse wheel, and after so many years of using the mouse we can point and click everything we want on the screen fast and concise.

There are some arguements in the web development community about writing code without a mouse is actually faster and more efficient.

I'm curious to try it out. I will try my best not to use VS Code with mouse and document How I use VS Code keyboard shortcut, and terminal CLI I had learned in this blog.

For so many years, I depend on the mouse. I not sure I can get used to it or not. What I pretty sure is my coding speed will decrease dramatically at first. I will share my experience about this later.
