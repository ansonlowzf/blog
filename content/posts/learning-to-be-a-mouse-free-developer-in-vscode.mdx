After using PC for so many years with a mouse or trackpad. We can point and click everything we want on the screen so fast and concise. Drag and drop, left-click, right-click, scroll the web page up and down with mouse wheel and so on.

There are some arguments in the web development community mention writing code without a mouse is faster and efficient.

I'm curious to try it out. My target is to focus 90% on using the keyboard and 10% on using the mouse. I don't think we can 100% avoid using a mouse in a graphic user interface (GUI) environment. Especially when we would like check out our website.

I will try my best just to use the keyboard,keyboard shortcut, terminal and command line in VS Code. Then document my learning to be a mouse free developer (should be a mouse-less developer more accurately).

For so many years, I depend on the mouse. I not sure I can get used to it or not. What I pretty sure is my coding speed will decrease dramatically. However, I'm pretty excited to learn this new thing. Wish me good luck.

Below are the keyboard shortcut and navigation I learned so far, I'll constantly update this blog when I learn something new.

## First few days

This is the hard part, I always use my trackpad unconsciously and always need to remind myself not to use it.

## New habit

Here are some of the new habits I gained when I'm learning to code with keyboard only.

1. Check line number
2. Always check whether cursor is on editor or explorer
3. I change my cursor color to yellow to make it more obvious

## Open a file

With **Go to file**

I often toggle the sidebar off with **_Ctrl + b_**. I navigate from file to file with **_Ctrl + e_** (you can also use **_Ctrl + p_**) then search the keyword of the filename and press **_enter_** to open the file.

**Example**:-

Your filename is **how-to-build-a-website-with-gatsbyjs.md**, you can just type **gatsbyjs** or **build a website**, VS Code will filter and show you every file match your search.

With **Breadcrumbs**

**_Ctrl + Shift + ._ (fullstop)** to focus your current breadcrumbs folder and use **_Ctrl + right/left arrow_** to navigate between folder, **_up/down arrow_** navigate between the file and press **_enter_** to open the file.

## Navigate between editor and explorer

I seldom navigate folder and file this way. I share this method to people who might find it useful.

When you want to open a file even with sidebar toggle off, you can **_Ctrl + Shift + e_** to focus on sidebar's explorer and **_Ctrl + Shift + e_** again to focus back to editor or

You can **_Ctrl + 0_** (Zero) (not working in number pad) to focus on sidebar's explorer, **_Ctrl + 1_** (not working in number pad) to focus back to editor

Use **_up and down arrow_** to navigate between the file.

Use **_left arrow_** to focus to folder and left arrow again to collapse the folder.

Use **_right arrow_** to focus to file and right arrow again to open a folder if it's collapsed.

## Navigate tab to tab

I use **Ctrl + page up** to focus on previous tab and **Ctrl + page down** to focus on next tab.

Alternately, you can use **Ctrl + tab** to focus on next tab or **Ctrl + Shift + tab** to focus on previous tab.

## Delete entire line

Don't press and hold **backspace** to delete character by character in a line. Said you want to delete line 28, place your cursor on line 28 in the editor **_Ctrl + Shift + k_** or **_Shift + delete_** to delete the line.

## Delete a word

**Ctrl + d** to select a word (whether you are in front, back or middle of the word), press **_delete_** in the keyboard to delete the word.

Place your cursor at the end of the word you want to delete, then **_Ctrl + backspace_** to delete the word

Place your cursor in front of the word, then **Ctrl + delete** to delete the word.

## Insert a line

When I am in the middle of a line and I want to move my cursor down to start a new line, I **Ctrl + enter**. If I want to push my existing line down and add a new line above, I **Ctrl + Shift + enter**.

## Moving cursor in the editor

1. **Right Arrow** move one character to the right from your current location
1. **Left Arrow** move one character to the left from your current location
1. **Up Arrow** move the cursor up one line, hold the press for faster move
1. **Down Arrow** move the cursor down one line, hold the press for faster move
1. **Ctrl + Right Arrow** move the cursor to the beginner of a word
1. **Ctrl + Left Arrow** move the cusor to the end of a word
1. **home** in the keyboard move cursor to the beginning of a line
1. **end** in the keyboard move cursor to the end of a line
1. **Ctrl + home** move the cursor to the beginning of the page
1. **Ctrl + end** move the cursor to the end of the page
1. **backspace** delete one character to the left
1. **delete** delete one character to the right

Move the cursor to the top of the editor **_page up_** in the keyboard and move the cursor to the bottom of the editor **_page down_** in the keyboard. I use it to scroll editor sometime.

## Move the cursor and select the word along the way

**Ctrl + Shift + Right Arrow** move cursor and select the word toward right

**Ctrl + Shift + Left Arrow** move cursor and select the word toward left

## Selection

1. **Ctrl + d** to select a word
1. **Ctrl + Shift + Right Arrow** to select a word toward the right
1. **Ctrl + Shift + Left Arrow** to select a word toward the left

## Scroll the editor

To scroll one line up **_Ctrl + Up Arrow_** and to scroll one line down **_Ctrl + Down Arrow_**, I use it to adjust my editor view.

## Terminal

I always close the VS Code terminal panel while I'm coding. When I want to add a file to the git staging area, I'll **_Ctrl + `(backtick)_** toggle terminal panel and **_git add [filename]_** then **_git commit -m 'description'_**.

I find that If you just stage one file, using VS Code built-in source control is faster. **_Ctrl + Shift + g_**, navigate to the file you want to stage, click the **&plus;** sign, write your description and **_Ctrl + enter_** to commit your change.

Imagine you want to stage the following two files at the same time:-

1. /posts/how-to-be-a-good-developer.md
2. /posts/how-to-be-a-web-designer.md

Long typing right? Even you want to use the tab auto-completion. You also need to type until the **_good_** or the **_web_** word then only you can tab to auto-complete the whole filename, isn't it? This is how I stage the file while I'm practising as a mouse-less developer.

### Local development server

I have the habit to always stop the development server before I close VS Code or turn off the computer. To avoid the possibility to forget to stop it later. I prefer to use an external terminal. **_Ctrl + Shift + c_** in VS Code to open external. You will notice the external terminal you just open is in your project directory. Having a terminal open in my windows taskbar reduce the possibility I forget to stop the server.

**Note**
Default to **_windows cmd_**. if you want to change to your favourite terminal, Open VS Code setting and search **_External: windows Exec_**
