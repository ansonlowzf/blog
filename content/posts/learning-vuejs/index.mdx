When I started to write this blog,

I built my company website and some other websites with React. In order not to mess up my google analytics, I better not to expose it here. Maybe next time I build a clone and share it with you.

## What I know before I learn Vue?

- Basic HTML & CSS (Not expert yet)
- Basic JavaScript (Forever in beginner level)
- ES6 and above features and syntax (Make me write JavaScript a little bit easier)
- NPM (Not sure how I know to run npm, but I did it)
- Beginner level of React knowledge (Next or Gatsby, without this framework building on top of React. I think I'm still lost in React world)

I learned Vue2 before, it's just after I finish learning HTML, CSS and JavaScript in FreeCodeCamp, Treehouse and some Udemy course.

Frankly speaking, I can't even build a website with Vue. Maybe is the Vue rules and way of writing code confused me during that time. I give up after learning for one month but still can't produce a website.

Today, when I revisit Vue, it already Vue3. Oh, times flies ~~~

## Test Vue with CDN

- Create a project folder name "learn-vue" in Desktop
- Right click and choose "Open with VS Code"
- Create "index.html" in the root directory
- Type "!" and press "tab" to expand the html boilerplate
- Go to Vue3 official website [https://v3.vuejs.org/](https://v3.vuejs.org/)
- Click "Get Started"
- Click "installation"
- Scroll down to CDN
- Found the script and import it before the "closing body tag"

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
