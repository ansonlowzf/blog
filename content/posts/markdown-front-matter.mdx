<ol>
  <li>
    <a
      href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/front-matter/"
      target="_blank"
      rel="noreferrer noopener"
    >
      Jekyll front-matter
    </a>
  </li>
  <li>
    <a
      href="https://gohugo.io/content-management/front-matter/"
      target="_blank"
      rel="noreferrer noopener"
    >
      Hugo front-matter
