This is one of the essential features you must know if you are blogging and writing your article in Markdown format.

## Frontmattter in Markdown

Appear on the top of the Markdown, must start from line 1 like so:-

```md
---
title: This is a title
date: YYYY-MM-DD
tags: ["tag A", "tag B", "tag C"]
excerpt: description
---
```

The properties and value written within the triple dashes are **frontmatter**.

I'm using Gatsby's markdown setup. You might have notice I didn't wrap the values in quotation mark. Gatsby setup will convert it to String for me in the background.

If you are using other markdown setup. You might need to write like this:-

```md
---
title: "This is a title"
date: "YYYY-MM-DD"
tags: ["tag A", "tag B", "tag C"]
excerpt: "description"
---
```

Did you notice the different? You write the value in "String".

## What frontmatter used for?

We use frontmatter to set variables and metadata on Markdown page then output to any page we want.

We could use it to display information in blog index page:-

![blog index page](../assets/blog-index-page.jpg)

If you are using Content Management System such as Jekyll or Hugo, they have **predefined global variables** you must follow. You could visit their frontmatter page:-

<ol>
  <li>
    <a
      href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/front-matter/"
      target="_blank"
      rel="noreferrer noopener"
    >
      Jekyll front-matter
    </a>
  </li>
  <li>
    <a
      href="https://gohugo.io/content-management/front-matter/"
      target="_blank"
      rel="noreferrer noopener"
    >
      Hugo front-matter
    </a>
  </li>
</ol>

## YAML or JSON

They both do the same thing but the writting method is different. The examples shown above are in JSON format. YAML format will be like so:-

```yaml
title: "this is title"
date: ""
tags:
  - tag A
  - tag B
  - tag C
```

## Custom variables

If you are setting up a Markdown blog yourself, you could define your own variables name. It's depend on the package you use. What frontmatter does is convert YAML or JSON you write to an object.

```md
---
custom_variable: "some text"
my_address: "address"
---
```

If you pass the props as data, you could access it like so:-

```js
<h1>{data.custome_variable}</h1>
<p>{data.my_address}</p>
```

Some example properties people often use:-

```md
---
title:
date:
excerpt:
author:
slug:
category:
coverImage:
---
```
