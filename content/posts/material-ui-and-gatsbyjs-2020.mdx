This is to share how I build a production-ready website with Material-UI & Gatsby.js.
It might not be perfect but this is what I can build with my self-taught knowledge.

## Install Gatsby.js

The best way to start a Gatsby.js project is to choose a starter from the [starter library][gatsby starter library].
You can save a lot of time.
You don't need to initial a create-react-app project then install Gatsby.js and every plugin yourself.
[gatsby starter library]: https://www.gatsbyjs.org/starters/?v=2

[gatsby-starter-default][gsd] is the most minimalist boilder plate I always choose to start a new Gatsby.js project.
You can always uninstall the plugins you don't need later.

Before you start a new Gatsby.js project, make sure you install gatsby-cli globally in your local machine.

```sh
npm install -g gatsby-cli
```

Gatsby-cli make you work a lot easier, e.g:-

1. Initial a new Gatsby.js project with a starter
2. Start development server
3. Remove local cache file
4. Compile your application and make it ready for deployment
5. Serve the production build in your local machine

**You will see all these in action in this blog**

To start a new Gatsby.js project with gatsby-cli

```sh
gatsby new my-project-name https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-default

cd my-project-name
gatsby develop -o
```

What is the "o" flag does?
It automatically open the project in your browser when starting the development server.
